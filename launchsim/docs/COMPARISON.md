## Using Multiple Tools

Many rocketeers use multiple simulators to cross-check results. A common workflow:

1. **Design** in OpenRocket (best component library)
2. **Validate** aerodynamics in RASAero II (for high-speed)
3. **Launch day** use LaunchSim (weather, mobile access, GO/NO-GO)
4. **Post-flight** import altimeter data to LaunchSim to compare

LaunchSim imports OpenRocket (.ork) files, so you can design elsewhere and use LaunchSim for launch day operations.

---

## Accuracy Notes

All simulation software makes assumptions and simplifications. Real-world factors that affect accuracy:

- Surface finish variations
- Manufacturing tolerances
- Wind gusts and turbulence
- Motor performance variations
- Temperature effects on propellant

**Recommendation:** Use simulations for planning, but always build in safety margins. No simulator perfectly predicts reality.
